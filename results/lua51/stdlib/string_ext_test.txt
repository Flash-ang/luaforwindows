  beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,With such name as
  "Nevermore."But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke onlyThat

  then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-Till I scarcely more than
  muttered, "other friends have flownbefore-On the morrow he will leave me, as
  my hopes have flown before."Then the bird said, "Nevermore."
